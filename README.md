# The gewt project

[![](https://github.com/esoco/gewt/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/esoco/gewt/actions)

This project contains the GEWT library which provides a generic user interface abstraction that wraps the open source Google Web Toolkit (GWT) for the actual user interface implementation. GEWT has the same API as EWT, a Java desktop user interface framework. GEWT makes it possible to build platform-independent user interfaces. Another important aspect of (G)EWT is that it provides a very simple and unified API for user interface implementations, freeing the developer from the need to handle the similar but differently implemented concepts of the UI toolkits.
