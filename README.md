# The gewt project

This project contains the GEWT library which provides a generic user interface abstraction that uses the open source Google Web Toolkit (GWT) as the actual user interface implementation. GEWT has the same API as EWT, a desktop user interface framework. With GEWT the same user interface can be displayed as a web application and vice versa with only minor adaptations. Another important aspect of EWT is that it provides a very simple and unified API for user interface implementations, freeing the developer from the need to handle the similar but differently implemented concepts of the UI toolkits.
